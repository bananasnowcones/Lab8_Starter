1. It would be best to go with the second option. You definitely want to run your own tests on the code before pushing and causing problems or muddying the github with many pushes to test code. It's also best to test individual components over finishing all code then testing development.
2. No, you'd be wise to use unit testing over end to end to test one single function.
3. I would probably do end to end testing to imitate user interaction of the message feature on the page itself. That's the goal with end to end testing!
4. Yes, in this case, it's a small individual component in the code that we can isolate and quantify there to see if it works the way we want it to work.
